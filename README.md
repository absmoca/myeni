## About the law...

In France, the copyright (called "Droit d'auteur") law has an exception called "private copy" ("Copie priv√©e") :

You may create a copy of something if the goal is a private usage. Two origins are public diffusion and bought things.

So, you are not able to use this PoC to publish a book on a hidden network :)

## More information...
- The application is in French, but not very hard to understand there are only a few words
- If you download several books, you will probably have to retrieve the cookies each time because the site uses timestamps.
- Last time i used it and it worked: *21/12/2020*
